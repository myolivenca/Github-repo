# Github-repo
Show github repository by user login name


Run the "website":
To start project just run index.html in a local server. I believe that will work in any web server, sib«nce is just pure html javascript and css files.


Extras:
Added a search box just for joy ;) 
Try search for "mhevery" or "joycepg" (the search event is fired after 1s with no action in the input field)


Unit Testing:
surf to /Testing/SpecRunner.html and you should see jasmine page with auto testing states. (all should pass)
